# Short Title Catalogue Flanders (STCV; Short Title Catalogus Vlaanderen)
Flanders Heritage Library is a network of libraries with special collections in the Flanders region of Belgium. As part of our mission, we maintain and develop several databases, one of which is the Short Title Catalogus Vlaanderen (STCV). 

The STCV project is developing a retrospective bibliography of publications from Flanders before 1801. The bibliographical descriptions in STCV are based on a thorough method for analytical bibliography of the hand press book. All descriptions are based on autopsies of copies held in library collections in Flanders, Brussels and beyond. 

##Ideal Copies##
The STCV has characteristics of both a catalogue and a bibliography. First and foremost, STCV describes _ideal copies_ (as intended by the printer), based on actual copies found in library collections. Additionally, it contains location information for the autopsied copies. Copy-specific information is limited to aspects that are relevant to the reconstruction of the ideal copy (binding errors and incompleteness).

The information is highly accurate: each description is created by one bibliographer and then verified by another. Editions are identified by a 'fingerprint', based on unique characteristics of the print run. This makes it possible to reliably identify books as copies of a particular edition. 

The STCV online catalogue can be found at http://stcv.be. Full documentation is available at http://manual.stcv.be.

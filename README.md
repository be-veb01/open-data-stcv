# Short Title Catalogue Flanders (STCV; Short Title Catalogus Vlaanderen)
[Flanders Heritage Library](http://vlaamse-erfgoedbibliotheek.be/en) is a network of libraries with special collections in the Flanders region of Belgium. As part of our mission, we maintain and develop several databases, one of which is the Short Title Catalogus Vlaanderen (STCV). 

The STCV project is developing a retrospective bibliography of publications from Flanders before 1801. The bibliographical descriptions in STCV are based on a thorough method for analytical bibliography of the hand press book. All descriptions are based on autopsies of copies held in library collections in Flanders, Brussels and beyond. 

## Ideal Copies
The STCV has characteristics of both a catalogue and a bibliography. First and foremost, STCV describes _ideal copies_ (as intended by the printer) of book editions, based on actual copies found in library collections. Additionally, it contains location information for the autopsied copies. Copy-specific information is limited to aspects that are relevant to the reconstruction of the ideal copy (binding errors and incompleteness).

The information is highly accurate: each description is created by one bibliographer and then verified by another. Editions are identified by a 'fingerprint', based on unique characteristics of the print run. This makes it possible to reliably identify books as copies of a particular edition. 

## Printers, Publishers and Booksellers
STCV contains authority records for printers, publishers and booksellers involved in the creation of the described editions, including name variants, addresses, sign and years of activity. This information is not yet available as structured data, but we are planning to publish it as an open dataset in the future.

## Content
* As per 2018-09-21, the database contains 24,871 bibliographical descriptions (editions) and 1,551 printer authority records.
* The dataset is fairly representative for the book production of the 17th century, but less so for other periods (see [list of included collections and periods (nl)](http://www.vlaamse-erfgoedbibliotheek.be/dossier/short-title-catalogus-vlaanderen/stcv-verwerkte-collecties#ELDERS)

## Potential Use ##
The STCV data may be of use to:
* Researchers in the humanities. While all data can be consulted via the STCV online catalogue, not all information can be queried or adequatly presented to facilitate certain types of research. We want to remedy this situation by providing full copies of the dataset that can be processed with research specific tools, for instance for statistical 

* _Omschrijf wie (een concreet stuk van) die data nodig heeft. (cf. je gebruikscenario)_
* _Omschrijf welke data je vrij toegankelijk maakt om die nood te lenigen._

## _[naam van je dataset]_
* _Omschrijf wat er concreet in je dataset zit. (cf. je dataprofiel)_
* _Omschrijf in welke formaat je data beschikbaar is._
* _Leg eventueel links naar visualisaties of API's._
